title: Hello to my blog
---

After conducting several surveys, I have ultimately chosen Hexo as my blogging platform. 
There is another popular platform called Hugo,  which is written in Go and is known for its fast speed. 
However, I opted for Hexo because it is written in Node.js,  and I discovered some beautiful themes on their website. Moreover, I believe that content holds more significance than the underlying technology stack at this point. Although, in the future, I might consider switching to Hugo, which is said to be user-friendly.
