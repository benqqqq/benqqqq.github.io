After conducting several surveys, I have ultimately chosen Hexo as my blogging platform.
There is another popular platform called Hugo,  which is written in Go and is known for its fast speed.
However, I opted for Hexo because it is written in Node.js,  and I discovered some beautiful themes on their website. Moreover, I believe that content holds more significance than the underlying technology stack at this point. Although, in the future, I might consider switching to Hugo, which is said to be user-friendly.


**2023/5/23 Update:** I have ultimately decided to switch to Hugo. There are several reasons for this change:

1. Hexo lacks built-in hot reload functionality.
2. I encountered issues with inserting images into my posts, which seemed to introduce bugs.

These two limitations led me to perceive Hexo as somewhat outdated. Conversely, Hugo has effectively addressed these concerns.
