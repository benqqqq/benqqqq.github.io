I'd like to write this article to document the process of implementing a customized Date Picker using MUI. I will begin by discussing how I perceive this problem. During my research, I also came across others who shared similar ideas, which can be found here:

One of the exciting aspects of working with Material-UI in a React project is the ability to customize components according to the specific needs of your application. But, how do you go about it without getting lost in a sea of properties and styles? This post aims to walk you through the process, providing an in-depth, practical guide to customizing Material-UI in your React applications.

Before we dive into the process, there a critical questions you should consider: Should you customize an existing Material-UI component, or build your own from scratch?

Here are three possible perspective to consider 

1. **What is the customization complexity level of your component?**
2. **How much we can benefit from Material-UI for this component?**
3. **How frequently you are going to edit this component?** 


These questions will help you gauge the scope of your customization task and guide your decisions throughout the process.

If you've decided to utilize Material-UI for your customization needs, there are three primary areas you can modify:

1. **Customize the theme: Alter the look and feel of your application at a global level.**
2. **Customize component UI: Modify the visual properties of specific components.**
3. **Customize component behavior: Change how your components behave when users interact with them.**

Let's delve into each of these areas.



## Should you customize an existing Material-UI component, or build your own from scratch?

### 1. What is the customization complexity level of your component?

This is about understanding the intricacy of the modifications you need to make. Simple modifications like color changes, typography, or small layout tweaks can be handled easily with Material-UI, while complex alterations might warrant a custom component.

- **Example Using Material-UI:** If you need a Button component with a different color scheme and typography, it's a matter of customizing the theme or directly modifying the style of Material-UI's Button.

- **Example Not Using Material-UI**: If you're tasked with designing a dynamic, multi-level dropdown component with features not supported by Material-UI's Dropdown, creating your own custom component might be the better approach.


However, the decision is tricky sometimes because we might think it is a simple customization until we implement the special logic then found everything is hack ...

My recommendation is to be familiar with what your ui framework (such as mui) can do, and start with a SPIKE


### 2. How much can you benefit from Material-UI for this component?

This factor is about measuring how much time and effort Material-UI can save you. If the component closely resembles an existing Material-UI component, the library can offer significant advantages. However, if Material-UI only meets a small portion of your requirements, building from scratch could be more beneficial.

Example Using Material-UI: Suppose you're developing a registration form with standard fields like Name, Email, Password, etc. Material-UI's form components can be quickly customized to suit your needs, saving you valuable development time.

Example Not Using Material-UI: If you need a highly customized slider with features like multiple handles and custom track and tooltip, which Material-UI's Slider component does not support, building your own slider might be the best choice.

## How to customize

### 1. Customizing the Theme
---
Material-UI provides a rich theming solution that lets you define global styles and design tokens for your application. This makes it easy to create a consistent look and feel across your entire app.

To create a custom theme, you need to use the createMuiTheme function from Material-UI and pass it an object containing your customizations.

```jsx
import { createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

const theme = createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#ff4400',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#0084ff',
    },
  },
});
export default theme;
```

In this code snippet, we've customized our theme's primary and secondary colors. The createMuiTheme function allows you to customize a myriad of other aspects, such as typography, spacing, breakpoints, and more.
